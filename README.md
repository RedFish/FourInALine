# FourInALine  
  
The purpose of this project is a game named Four In a Line. Itâ€™s a game between two players. Each player has one color's disc and has to put discs in the grid (six rows and seven columns), each one after the other. The aim is to connect four discs in a row, column or diagonally.  

We manage to implement three ways to play the game. So, you can play by your own against the computer with different levels of difficulties, play against another player on the same screen or play online through the Internet. This application uses video, background music, animations, HTTP queries and much more.
